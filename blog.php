                    There are four main blood types (A, B, O and AB), which are determined by the presence or absence of certain antigens on the surface of red blood cells. Individuals are also typed as either Rh positive or Rh negative depending on the presence or absence of the most important red cell antigen in the Rh blood group. It is helpful to know your blood type in planning your future. The right type at the right time can save lives in your community.

                    Iron is important for making red blood cells and transporting oxygen. Loss of red blood cells through blood donation may deplete the body of iron over time, and frequent blood donors may become low on iron before becoming anemic. Young women are particularly at risk of low iron due to blood loss during their menstrual cycles. Diet alone may not be enough to replace iron, especially if you have gastrointestinal issues or do not eat red meat.

                    High cholesterol is considered an indicator of cardiovascular disease risk. For adults age ≥ 20 years of age, the desirable level is less than 200 mg/dL. Values of 200 to 239 mg/dL are borderline high risk, and values above 240 mg/dL are considered high risk for cardiovascular disease. If your value is above 200 mg/dL you should consult with your physician. For adolescents under 20 years of age, the desirable level is less than 170 mg/dL. Values of 170 to 199 mg/dL are borderline high risk, and values above 200 mg/dL are considered high risk for cardiovascular disease. If your value is above 170 mg/dL, you should also consult with your physician.<br>
                    Pulse is the number of heartbeats per minute. An expected pulse is 60-100 beats per minute. Generally, a lower heart rate means a more efficient heart function and better cardiovascular fitness.

                    <b>1. PROCESSING :-</b> After you give blood, we begin testing and processing your blood so it can be used to give life. For each donation, blood samples are tested to make sure it can be transfused to patients safely.<br>
                    <b>2. TRANSFUSION :-</b> Transfusion is the process by which a doctor or medical professional prescribes blood products for a patient using blood donated by someone like you. On average, one in every seven hospital patients is in need of a life-saving blood transfusion.<br>
                    <b>3. Research :-</b> Carter BloodCare works with local and regional academic institutions and select commercial entities and vendors in developing new services and products related to blood transfusion, cellular therapy and supportive services.

                    The most common type of blood donation is whole blood where one unit (roughly one pint) of blood is taken from a donor. The donation is called “whole blood” because the blood is taken in its entirety, for separation into its component parts later in the lab. This donation process takes about one hour from the time the donor comes in, to the time the donor is ready to leave. The donation itself takes only 10 to 15 minutes. Whole blood donations can be performed every 56 days.

                <p align="justify">
                    Automated donations are done by a process called “apheresis,” which allows the donor to maximize his or her donation for their blood type and give specific components. The apheresis instrument uses sterile tubing, chambers and needles to ensure a safe donor experience. The selected component or components are saved and the remaining blood is returned to the donor. Most automated donations consist of a combination of platelets, red cells and plasma, usually 2 of the 3 components.
